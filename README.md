# Comfort Icons
Webpage describing comfort icon set created for my Art, Design, and Digital Culture class (DSGN 264).
See the site live on [Github Pages](https://conswang.github.io/comfort-icons/) (～￣▽￣)～

As usual, the HTML and CSS turned into a mess and the site is not responsive. Also, the animations only work on Chrome. So please view on Chrome on a computer. Thanks! (＾Ｕ＾)ノ~ＹＯ
